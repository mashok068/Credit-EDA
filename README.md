# Credit-EDA
This case study aims to apply EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of  Exploratory Data Analysis, we develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
